# DL-Model-for-Drone-Detection
## Introduction
This project proposes a drone detection and tracking system using image processing and deep learning techniques. The model is based on the YOLOv7 deep learning model, trained on a large dataset of multiple drone images. The proposed approach employs the YOLO model for object detection in real-time video streams captured by a surveillance camera. The performance of the system was evaluated using various test cases and compared with state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset. The results showed that the proposed system achieved decent accuracy and real-time processing capabilities in detecting and tracking drones, even in complex and cluttered environments.
## Dataset Description
Dataset- VISIODECT DATASET: AN AERIAL DATASET FOR SCENARIO-BASED MULTI-DRONE DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION (https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/visiodect-dataset-aerial-dataset-scenario-based-multi-drone-detection-and-identification)

For detection and classification, a dataset of 14,076 drone samples captured at different altitudes (30mâ€“100m) and scenarios (cloudy, sunny/normal, and evening) and environments to form our test environment is used. Five drone models namely: DJI Phantom, Mavic2-Air, Mavic2-Air Enterprise, and Mavic2-Enterprise Zoom were used for this study. From which 11,701 images are used for training and rest 2375 images are used for validation. To depict the planned circumstances, each drone model was launched into the air from various places, at various heights and distances from the pilots, on various days of the week and at various times of day. Each of these flying operations had video sequences that were recorded during a variety of time periods. In order to improve data quality and prevent errors, insufficient training data, and non-representative data that might lead to model overfitting, this exercise was conducted over several months.

## Result
The proposed drone detection and tracking system using YOLO achieved decent accuracy in detecting and tracking drones in real-time. The optimized YOLO algorithm achieved a detection accuracy of over 57.27% on the test set, and a precision and recall of over 96%. The proposed system also demonstrated robustness in detecting multiple drones and distinguishing drones from other objects in the environment.
